Whats BrickBreaker?
Its retro arkanoid-style game made for fun. Its not many good ones of this kind and I tried to make this one fun. Its also my first serious game project. I spend about 5 months polishing and learning and putting it all together. With great help of my girlfriend who made tons of graphics for this game. 
I hope people will enjoy playing this one :)

What can be done in BrickBreaker?
- You have several pickup boxes to ease your progress:
    - Magic shots - same button used to launch the ball shoots magic shots to damage normal bricks   
    - Fireball - cant be missing, fiery ball rushing through all the bricks, even indestructible ones!
    - Enlarge - with this baby your paddle will grow and give some ease into bouncing ball back. Multiple Enlarge pickups makes paddle bigger and bigger - to some extend.
    - Extra life - BrickBreaker is challenging game, especialy on handy, but dont wory, this pickup will give you extra life to play longer.
    - Glue - this pickup drops gluey layer on a paddle, allowing you to shoot more precise and without stress.
    - Multiplier - Every ball gets multiplied (to some extend) to help swipe the level fater.
    
As adition to normal arkanoid games, you can shake the balls randomly by pressing button in the left upper corner. It can be used if ball gets slow, or you would wait ages for it, or simply want to gamble and hope, that ball will change direction where you want. And it does often!    

Another addition is possibility to continue to last reached level, so you dont have to play from the beginning. You get less score this way, of course.

 Score system in BrickBreaker is made, so with more lifes, you get more score. So if you play good from the beginning till the end, you get a lot of point. If you continue and lose lots of lifes, your score wont be probably very good :) Score is saved so you can see you progress.
 
  But most important is - have fun! :)
